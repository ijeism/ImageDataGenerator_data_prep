# ImageDataGenerator_data_prep
Organizes a directory of raw, labelled images (class deductable from img path) into required structure for use with Tensorflow ImageDataGenerator.



And example of structuring data such that it becomes suitable for use with Tensorflow's ImageDataGenerator can be seen in [this Notebook](https://github.com/ijeism/ImageDataGenerator_data_prep/blob/master/image_recognition_structure_data_for_ImageDataGenerator.ipynb).
